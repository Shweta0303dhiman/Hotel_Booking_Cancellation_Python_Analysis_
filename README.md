## Project Objective
- With help of Python's data visualization libraries (e.g.Matplotlib, Seaborn)and various data analysis techniques to uncover patterns and insights that can help 
  hotels optimize their booking processes, reduce cancellation rates, and improve revenue management strategies.
  
## Key Features
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
   - The dataset underwent extensive cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. The process ensured that the data was in optimal 
     condition for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Conducted to understand the distribution of key variables, correlations, and trends.
3. Visualization: 
   - Visualizations illustrate the relationships between different variables and cancellation likelihood.
4. Insights and Recommendations:
   - Based on the analysis, actionable insights and recommendations were provided to help hotel managers implement strategies to minimize cancellations.

## Technologies Used
-  Programming Languages: Python
-  Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
-  Tools: Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure
-  Data: Contains the raw and processed datasets used in the analysis.
-  Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing the data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
-  Reports: Includes the final report and presentation summarizing the findings.

## Results
-  Key Findings: The analysis revealed that factors like booking lead time, customer type, and special requests significantly impact the likelihood of 
   cancellations.

## Conclusion
-  This project provides valuable insights into hotel booking cancellation behavior and offers a predictive model that can assist hotels in reducing their 
   cancellation rates. The findings can help hotels implement targeted strategies to enhance customer retention and optimize revenue.

## Suggestions
-  In order to prevent cancellation hotels could work on their pricing strategies, like providing discount or lower down the rates.
-  Hotels need to work on the quality of their services and management to attract,impress customers.
