## Project Objective
- With help of Python's data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)and various data analysis techniques to uncover patterns and insights that can help hotels optimize their booking processes, reduce cancellation rates, and improve revenue management strategies.
  
## Key Features
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
   - The dataset underwent extensive cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. The process ensured that the data was in optimal 
     condition for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Conducted to understand the distribution of key variables, correlations, and trends.
3. Statistical Analysis:
   - Conducted to understand the distribution of key variables, correlations, and trends.
4. Visualization: 
   - Visualizations illustrate the relationships between different variables and cancellation likelihood.
5. Insights and Recommendations:
   - Based on the analysis, actionable insights and recommendations were provided to help hotel managers implement strategies to minimize cancellations.

## Technologies Used
-  Programming Languages: Python
-  Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
-  Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git
